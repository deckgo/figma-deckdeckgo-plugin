## Getting Started

[DeckDeckGo] is an open source web editor for presentations.

This plugin, once installed in [Figma], can be used to export frames to [DeckDeckGo] slides. The assets are exported as `webp` images and optionally, texts are extracted to make these editable in the editor.

## How to?

- Use the [plugin] to export your frames
- Download the resulting asset as zip file
- Go to the DeckDeckGo [editor](https://app.deckdeckgo.com)
- Import the data to create a new deck

## Design Guidelines

There are currently no check on the frame ratio. Nevertheless, we suggest the use of a 16/9 ratio.

It is also worth to notice that [DeckDeckGo] supports currently only a few fonts and, one family per decks.

## Development
